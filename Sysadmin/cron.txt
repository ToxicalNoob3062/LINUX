cron is a daemon runned bby root for task automation in linux
to operate cron we usally use crontabs 

crontab files:
1)file that contains info about cron jobs is:
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/
2)file that holds the crontab command:
/usr/bin/crontab
3)for configuration of crontabs:
/etc/crontabs
4)for seeing the logs of cron jobs
tail -f /var/log/syslog

2 types of cron jobs:
a)individual cron jobs:
(crontab -l) list all cron jobs for user
(crontab -e) edit the cron tab of active user
(crontab -r) to remove cron tabs
b)system cron jobs;

(-u user) to do anything that can a user do.
