                       dd->disk destroyer

(dd if="inputdrive" of="outputdrive" status="progress")

if (of="outputdrive") then output will be over written to disk or partision
if (of="disk.img") will overwtite if disk.img exist or will create a new file disk.img which will consume the memory of external disk instead of overwriting the disk in which the file is being copied by dd command

the dd command copies both empty and filled spaces. So it will consume the full store equal to your external drive capacity

(dd if=disk.img of=/dev/sda)
to copy all the data of a disk image to a disk.

(dd if=input_file of=output_file conv=sync)
The (sync) option is an option that can be used with the dd command to synchronize the data and metadata buffers of a file system after the data has been written.

(dd if="/dev/sda" of="/root/mbr.dat" bs=512 count =1)
In this case, the dd command will read the first 512 bytes of the first disk and write it to the mbr.dat file. This will create a copy of the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the first disk. The MBR is a special type of data structure that is used to boot an operating system on a computer, and it is stored in the first sector of the disk.

(dd if="/root/mbr.dat" of="/dev/sda" bs=512 count =1)
to copy the master-boot-record from mbr.dat file to a speicific drive.

you can do the same for a iso file to boot a linux distro from usb 
(dd if="/root/gile.iso" of="/dev/usb" status="progress")
will send the iso file content setted up to usb for booting.
