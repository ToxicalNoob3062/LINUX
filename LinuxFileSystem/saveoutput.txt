(command > filename.format) to save the output in a file!
if the file isnt present it creates that file otherwise its overwrite that file!use >> to append instead of overwrite.

The terminal can also be used as a file.Get Terminal file path->(tty)

show output in one terminal from other->(command > termialpath)

stdout->1 & stderr->2. We can use this numbers in command to handle this two cases separately!
(command >output.txt 2>error.txt), (> or 1>) is samething.

sometimes one command can produce both output and error at the same time! (tail -n 2 /etc/passwd /etc/shadow)

appending both cases in same file->(tail -n 2 /etc/passwd /etc/shadow >> all.txt 2>&1) , for overwriting use > istead of >>

(cut -d"" -f"num") splits all lines with delimeter and num indicates the serial number of the word separated by delimeter!

if we want to see the output in terminal and also save it on file at the same time we will need (tee) command piped with main command.
tee only works with stdout.

(command | tee file.txt)    will overwrite and 
(command | tee -a file.txt) will append to file
