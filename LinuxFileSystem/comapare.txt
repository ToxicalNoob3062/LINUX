we can compare files in linux by using (cmp file1 file2 and so-on)
will provide the line number in which all the files differ.

instead of cmp we can also use sha256sum and diff !

diff outputs!
This signs will instruct us how to make both files same.
c->replace, d->delete, a->append
< ->firstfile 
> ->secondfile

diff options! This options will instruct diff command to compare  both files maintaining some conditions!
-B ignore blanklines
-w ignore whitespaces
-i ignore casedifferrences
-c more detailed comparision
-y side by side comparision
