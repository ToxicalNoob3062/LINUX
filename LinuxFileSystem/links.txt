hard links and inode:files reserve memory on disk by a inode number and file names are just refferenced to it!

(find dir -inum nodenumber) will provide you all the present file connected to that node in that dir.
(find dir -links +-=n) here n indicates link number.
(ln file1 fil2e) will link fil2 with fil1

symlinks are nothing but directory shortcuts!
(ln -s src des) to create a symlink
symlink will not work if main file path is changed because the symlink just a referrence or copy of that directory path!
