Creating:
make nesting folders using (mkdir -p nestedpath)
use (touch) to create files

Copying:

(cp src-file dest-file) will copy the data of src file and overwrite it to destfile.
add (-i) to ask before overwriting will help us to remember that same file already exists.

(cp -i file1 file 2 file 3 dir/) will save all 3 files in dir

(cp -R dir1 dir2) will copy dir1 in dir2 recursively.

awlays use (-p) to preserve (auth and timestamp cred) and avoid (overwriting accidents) while (copying and creating) files or dir

Move and Renaming :
(mv -i (file1 file2 file3) dir) will move all 3 files in the dir.
(mv -i (dir1 dir2 dir3)    dir) will move all 3 dir in the dir.
use (-u) to only move if its possible to move without overwriting!

keep the src and destination path same to rename using mv.
(mv dir/name dir/rename)

move a file and rename at the same timestamp
(mv dir/fname dir/dir2/f-rename)

Removing:
file-> (rm -i file)
dir->  (rm -iR dir)

Removing data safely:
(shred -vun num file or dir) num indicates show many times data to be over-written. this only works for file.

(srm -vr path ) will delete your directory and also overwrite it with random data.
