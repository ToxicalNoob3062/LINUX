you can do all kind of complex searching using (grep) command in a file. (grep opt pattern file)

(-i) case insensitive
(-n) to print out line number
(-w) to search for whole words
(-v) show lines that do not match that pattern
(-a) to search in binary files
(-R) to search a pattern recusively in all files in a dir
(-s) to avoid unreadable files in output
(-c) to get the number of lines given as output
(-A n) show n lines after the firstmatch
(-B n) show n lines before the firstmatch
(-C n) show n lines before & after the firstmatch
(-e "\.ext$") to search a file with extension.


use (sort) command to sort by name inascending order
and (sort -r) for descending order.

(strings binaryfile) extracts all string from a binary file
