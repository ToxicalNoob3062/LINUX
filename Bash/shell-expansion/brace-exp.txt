brace-expansion:

a)string lists
Will separate (,) separated values by space after concating prefix and suffix. such as command exp=(prefix{v1,v2,v3,(exp2)...}suffix)
->command prefix+v1+suffix prefix+v2+suffix ....
you can also do nesting of brace expansion.

b)sequence lists
{0..100..3} print 0 to 100 with an increment of 3 each time.
{a..z..n} print a to z by skipping (n-1) characters each time.
brace expansion priority is more than variable expansion.
you can also do this sequence listing in descending order.
