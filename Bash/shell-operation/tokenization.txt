bash use meta char to break the command into tokens.

metachars->space,tab,newline,|,;&()<>

when the input line is splitted into parts using metachars as IFS are consideres tokens.Among them:tokens->2 types
a)words-> quoted and no metachars.
b)operator->only matters if they are unqoted. contain atleast one metachar!
