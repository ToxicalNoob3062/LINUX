SHEBANG or #!
this is used to specify the compiler to run an executable script if not specified it will consider the default bash.
(#!/bin/bash executable) or you can add (#!/bin/bash) at top of the executable file to decide it will use which compiler to run that executable file.

#to directly execute bash files by their names from any place add the bash dir which contains bash files to the PATH varibale.
you can do this by adding a line :
(export PATH="dir-path:$PATH") try to put the dir-path an absolute one.

running a script with (source) command will set the variables inside the script to current shell session and you can acces those variable from terminal doin (echo $var) but running directly will not save the varibles in shell environment with is more preferable in case of programming. (.) command is same as (source) command.


Do not need executable permissions:(if you directly write the compiler name):
bash file
python3 file
source file
