change-owner:
(chown ownername (file or dir))
1)to change owner you need to be root even if you are the owner.
2)you can also change owner using (uid) that you will get from (/etc/passwd) or (id) command
3)there is a possibility of collision with username and userid so try to use +uid with chown to avoid collision.
4) (chown ownername:groupname file) will change both owner and group name.

5) use -R option to change owner of a dir and everything inside it.

change-group:
(chgrp grpname (file or dir))
