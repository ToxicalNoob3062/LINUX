checking ports in client pc:

check all open ports
(sudo netstat -tupan) | grep :(port) or (sudo ss -tupan)
0.0.0.0->listening to all ip addresses of host

lsof->it is a utility that displays information about files that are open by processes running on the system. 
(lsof) gives list of all open files
(lsof -u usrname) opened files by usr.
(lsof -u ^usrname) not opened files by usr.
(lsof -c command) oppend by the process created by a specific command.
(sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -nP).
The -iTCP option tells lsof to limit the output to information about TCP network connections, and the -sTCP:LISTEN option tells it to further filter the output to show only connections that are in the listening state.
-nP converts name to number.
(-iTCP:port) if you need a specific port instead of all tcp port.

checking ports in server pc:
(telnet s-ip port) to check if a port is open in remote server.
(sudo nmap ip) to check all active ports of server 
(nmap -p port ip) to search for a specfic ip
