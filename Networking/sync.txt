we can also sync files and dir using ssh
1)server needs to have read access on client
2)client needs to have write access on server 
according to the user they are logged in into the server.

(rysnc -av -e "ssh -p 22" --delete usrnme@sip:spath cpath) and vise versa!!.
use --delete only if you want to keep the sync between two directories exactly same! because it will synchronize and also delete extra files.
